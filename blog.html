          <h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl">1. The difference between map(),filter(),find() and forEach() ?</h2>
          <p class="py-5">&#8594;
            map() is used for transforming each element in an array and returning a new array with the same length.
            <br>
            &#8594; filter() is used for creating a new array with only the elements that meet a certain criteria.
            <br>
            &#8594; find() returns the first element in an array that satisfies a given condition. It returns undefined if no element satisfies the condition. find() stops searching the array as soon as it finds an element that satisfies the condition. Once the condition is met, find() does not continue searching for other elements that may satisfy the condition. find() returns only one element that meets the condition.
            <br>
            &#8594; forEach() is used for executing a function on each element in an array without returning a new array
          </p>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl">2. The difference Local Storage, Session Storage, Cookie ?</h2>
          <p class="py-5">&#8594; Local storage provides a larger storage space compared to cookies, and data stored in local storage remains available even after the user closes the browser or turns off their device. Session storage is similar to local storage,but automatically cleared when the browser is closed. Cookies are used for storing small amounts of data and they can be accessed by any page from the same domain.</p>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl">3. What is event loop? How does it works ?</h2>
          <p class="py-5">&#8594; An event loop is a programming construct that allows an application to efficiently handle multiple events and tasks concurrently without blocking or wasting resources. <br>
            &#8594; The event loop works by using a queue to store pending events. When an event is triggered, it is added to the back of the queue.
            The loop then retrieves the next event from the front of the queue and dispatches it to the appropriate handler. Once the handler completes, the loop retrieves the next event and repeats the process.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl">4. quizTimer() ?</h2>
          <p>&#8594; quizTimer() is work is to keep the timer running until we stop it. If the time is more than 60 seconds then its color will change. The whole function will show after one second. If we close the function it will be exited from this function </p>
          <h2 class="font-semibold text-2xl">5. chooseQuiz() ?</h2>
          <p>&#8594; chooseQuiz() Function Its work is to select an answer from a quiz question. After sorting, the answers will be in the form of a list in the quiz data.Then display the result.</p>
